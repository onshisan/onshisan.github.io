This is Greg Smith's personal GitHub Pages site, which consists of a résumé and provisions for a blog (the latter is not currently in use).

The main purpose of this site is to experiment with static site generation.

In particular, the CV published here is generated from the include 'resume.html', which itself uses a CSV data file to populate the frequently-updated list of courses from Canada School of Public Service.

In future this approach may be extended to incorporate additional use of data files, working towards complete separation of content and formatting to achieve allowing easy publication of multiple styles of CV, all of which would automatically synchronize changes in the underlying data.
