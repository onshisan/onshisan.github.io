In the first of what will likely be many tweaks to this site's design, this week I've decided to try out [Fira Code](https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode) throughout to replace the various humdrum fonts that shipped with the Jekyll template.

Recently I've been experimenting with fonts specifically designed for coding in my text editors of choice - both at work and in my free time - and this free option is actually quite good, especially the [ligatures](https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode/blob/master/extras/ligatures.png) and glyphs.

Does this make it an ideal web font? Not necessarily, but given the [MARC](https://www.loc.gov/marc/bibliographic/)-esque design I've chosen for [my CV](https://onshisan.github.io/cv) and the fact that it's the main focus of this site I decided to give it a whirl.

This is also the first time I've used [WOFF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_Open_Font_Format) fonts in a personal project. So far, so good.

Fira Code doesn't sport the extensive character set support of Microsoft's [Cascadia Code](https://github.com/microsoft/cascadia-code), for example, but in my brief trial period it's really grown on me.

This might be a gateway to more expensive alternatives (indeed, I went down this path after being bombarded by ads for a different font that shall remain nameless on social media) but only time will tell.
