This is a test post for my new site, which is powered by [Gibhub Pages](https://pages.github.com/)' [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) features. 

The design and layouts were originally based on [jmcglone](https://github.com/jmcglone)'s [Quinlan](https://github.com/jmcglone/quinlan), which proved to be an excellent foundation on which to build and tinker.

Over time I expect that this site will change significantly, but for now my aim is to use it as a test bed for experiments with static site generation, especially as I become for familliar with the [Liquid](https://shopify.github.io/liquid/) [implementation in Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/liquid/).
